Library of Effective GO routines
================================

This is a Library of Effective GO routines (libEGO), a high performance
implementation of Go rules and most popular algorithms used in computer Go.


Installation
------------

You will need:
 * git (version control system)
 * cmake (cross-platform, open-source build system)

Checkout the source:

    git clone git://github.com/lukaszlew/libego.git

Construct library and examples with your favorite compiler:

    ./cmakeall          # do all the work

Run GTP engine:

    ./bin/libego.sh     # Same as ./bin/engine but loads pattern gammas from a file.
    ./bin/libego.sh gui # Experimental gui for making experiments :)

You can connect engine to GoGui using first command.
