Library of Effective GO routines
================================

This is a Library of Effective GO routines (libEGO), a high performance
implementation of Go rules and most popular algorithms used in computer Go.


Installation
------------

You will need:
 * git (version control system)
 * cmake (cross-platform, open-source build system)

Checkout the source:

    git clone git://github.com/lukaszlew/libego.git

Construct library and examples with your favorite compiler:

    export CXX=g++-4.2  # set your favorite compiler, optional
    ./cmakeall          # do all the work

Light playout benchmark:

    echo "benchmark" | ./bin/engine
    echo "benchmark 1000000" | ./bin/engine

Run exemplary GTP engine:

    ./bin/engine
    ./bin/engine config.gtp -

The second command will first execute GTP commands from config.gtp.
And then take commands from stdin.
You can connect engine to GoGui usigng both of above commands.
